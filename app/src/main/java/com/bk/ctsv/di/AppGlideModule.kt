/**
 * Glide v4 uses an annotation processor to generate an API that allows applications to access all
 * options in RequestBuilder, RequestOptions and any included integration libraries in a single
 * fluent API.
 *
 * The generated API serves two purposes:
 * Integration libraries can extend Glide’s API with custom options.
 * Applications can extend Glide’s API by adding methods that bundle commonly used options.
 *
 * Although both of these tasks can be accomplished by hand by writing custom subclasses of
 * RequestOptions, doing so is challenging and produces a less fluent API.
